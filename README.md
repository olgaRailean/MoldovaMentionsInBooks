# Moldova mentions in various books ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡©

This is a repository of books in which I have encountered unexpected mentions of the Republic of Moldova. And as such, this is not a collection of books about Moldova or written by its citizens. These are books where you wouldn't expect that the country, its citizens, or anything Moldovan would be mentioned at all. Some books have entire chapters dedicated to something Moldovan, others just a brief mention.  

This list is in no way comprehensive, but I am welcoming any additions. A brief context of how/why Moldova is mentioned is also included, with any additional information for further exploration.
