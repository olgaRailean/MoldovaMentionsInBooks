# Moldova mentions in various books

This is a repository of books in which I have encountered unexpected mentions of the Republic of Moldova. And as such, this is not a collection of books about Moldova, but where the country, its citizens, or anything Moldovan was briefly mentioned.  This is in no way comprehensive, but I welcome any additions. A brief context of how/why Moldova is mentioned is also included. 

Spoilers ahead!
